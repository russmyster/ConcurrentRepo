A condition evaluates a proposition to a boolean, true or false.

A nested if/else statement
- CHECKS EVERY CODE BLOCK
- Only one code block gets executed
- The else is a catchall statement that will be executed IF no other statements are true

getValue() and toString() are called accessor methods
- 
our labs and projects will involve
the programmer defined class, (MOST WORK), like the shuffle methods
and the application class (less work) 

string does not need to be instantiated 
for it to receive the return value from the toString method
