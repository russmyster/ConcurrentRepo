Java keyword: "this"
- this is a java keyword that acts as a reference variable, but it doesn't need instantiation
- this holds a memory address of an object
- this can be used in any class we write, but in csc120, 
it will most often be used in the programmer defined class

ex) 
// Application class

public static void main(String[] args){
    PhoneBookEntry [...]
    // REFER TO PHOTO GALLERY OF THIS SLIDE
}
