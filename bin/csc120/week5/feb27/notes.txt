scope is a reference to the location(s) where certain variables can be used
- e.g. if int value is located within a class, it can only be accessed within that class

the card constructor is a parameterized constructor, since it has a parameter in its header
--> the parameter type is int

an example of a "local" variable is "suitNumber," since it is only declared within the Card constructor

all accessors have the word get in front of it (not necessarily the other way around ofc)
- getValue() is a method that is located in the Card class
--> to find getValue() of a card, we must do card1.getValue();

String str = card1.toString();
- is a valid statement because the toString method itself instantiates a string for you
--> str stores the *address* to the string that the toString method instantiated

public Card dealCard()
- is a valid statement too, as dealCard
